# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

You need an .env File that contains the following variables to run / deploy all contracts:

INFURA_API_KEY,
MNEMONIC,
SEPOLIA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
